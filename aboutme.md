# About Me

I’ve explored the intersection of data, engineering, and business through experiences at Amazon, where I supported regional cost optimization as a Financial Data Analyst, and at Procter & Gamble, where I improved manufacturing efficiency as a Process Engineering Intern. I’ve also contributed to academic and campus initiatives, serving as a Teaching Assistant for Supply Chain Management and mentoring first-year students as a Peer Advisor. Beyond the classroom, I led the Cornell Hyperloop structures subteam and built data-driven tools, including a cropland classification app using satellite imagery and a predictive model for community violent crime rates. I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and create scalable, impactful solutions.

I'm originally from Northern New Jersey and currently based in Ithaca, New York. Outside of work and academics, I love spending time with my Yorkshire Terrier, Toffee, and starting my mornings with iced coffee—no matter how cold it gets. I'm always up for trying new restaurants or exploring new places. During my time in Seattle for a previous Amazon internship, I developed a love for hiking, and I'm excited to be heading back to Seattle this summer for another internship. In quieter moments, I enjoy knitting, which has become one of my favorite ways to unwind.
