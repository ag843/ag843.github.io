### [Analysis of Violent Crime Rates](https://github.com/ag843/Violent-Crime-Rates-Analysis/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20Community%20Violent%20Crime%20Rates.pdf)

As part of my final project for ORIE 3120, I worked with a team to analyze the relationship between socioeconomic factors and community violent crime rates using a real-world dataset from the UCI repository. We performed exploratory data analysis and built predictive models, including linear, quadratic, and logistic regression. Our quadratic models, which focused on features like percentage of Black residents and percentage of population under the poverty line, achieved high RÂ² values (up to 90.7%), explaining a significant portion of variance in violent crime rates. We also developed a logistic regression model with train/test split to predict community safety classifications, achieving strong ROC metrics while identifying challenges caused by class imbalance. The project emphasized the importance of model interpretability and real-world biases in machine learning applications.

### Toyota Material Handling

For my Master of Engineering Capstone Project, I am working with a team to develop a Python-based solution to streamline domestic part ordering for Toyota Material Handling. Our goal is to optimize inventory management processes by automating parts classification and order recommendations. This project has strengthened my experience applying data-driven solutions to real-world supply chain challenges, with a focus on practical operational improvements.

### [Crop Classification App](https://ee-ashnagupta.projects.earthengine.app/view/cultivate-land-prediction)

I independently developed a remote sensing application that classifies cropland using Landsat 8 satellite imagery in Google Earth Engine. The model predicts cultivated areas across South Dakota and Minnesota for training, and North Dakota and Minnesota for testing, achieving approximately 73% accuracy. The application features a split-panel user interface that displays predictions side-by-side with actual labels, automatically zooming into a specific area of interest to enable detailed visual comparison. Built with a random forest classifier, the tool provides valuable insights into cultivated land distribution across the tested regions. You can explore the live application [here](https://ee-ashnagupta.projects.earthengine.app/view/cultivate-land-prediction).
