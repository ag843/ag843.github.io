### [Analysis of Violent Crime Rates](https://github.com/ag843/Violent-Crime-Rates-Analysis/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20Community%20Violent%20Crime%20Rates.pdf)

As part of my final project for ORIE 3120, I worked with a team to analyze the relationship between socioeconomic factors and community violent crime rates using a real-world dataset from the UCI repository. We performed exploratory data analysis and built predictive models, including linear, quadratic, and logistic regression. Our quadratic models explained up to 90.7% of the variance in crime rates. We also developed a logistic regression model with train/test split to predict community safety classifications, achieving strong ROC metrics while identifying challenges caused by class imbalance. The project emphasized the importance of model interpretability and real-world biases in machine learning applications.

### Toyota Material Handling

For my Master of Engineering Capstone Project, I am working with a team to modernize and automate the parts ordering system at Toyota Material Handling. We are developing a Python-based classification tool, supported by a SQL database, to streamline part categorization within their "Plan for Every Part" (PFEP) system. Our tool uses historical ordering data, supplier distance, lead time, and usage variability to recommend optimized ordering strategies, aligning with Toyotaâ€™s lean manufacturing and continuous improvement principles. The project focuses on local suppliers to the Indiana plant and aims to reduce inventory costs, improve inventory turnover, and minimize manual categorization errors. In addition to the backend automation, we are building a user-friendly interface and Power BI dashboards to help operational teams quickly visualize parts data and track key performance metrics. This experience has strengthened my skills in supply chain analytics, database management, and the application of lean principles to large-scale industrial operations.

### [Crop Classification App](https://ee-ashnagupta.projects.earthengine.app/view/cultivate-land-prediction)

I independently developed a remote sensing application that classifies cropland using Landsat 8 satellite imagery in Google Earth Engine. The model predicts cultivated areas across South Dakota and Minnesota for training, and North Dakota and Minnesota for testing, achieving approximately 73% accuracy. The application features a split-panel user interface that displays predictions side-by-side with actual labels, automatically zooming into a specific area of interest to enable detailed visual comparison. Built with a random forest classifier, the tool provides valuable insights into cultivated land distribution across the tested regions. You can explore the live application [here](https://ee-ashnagupta.projects.earthengine.app/view/cultivate-land-prediction).
