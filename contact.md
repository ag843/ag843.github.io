# About Me

Hi! I'm Ashna Gupta, a Master of Engineering student in Operations Research & Information Engineering (ORIE) at Cornell University, with a concentration in Data Analytics.

I‚Äôm passionate about solving real-world problems using data, optimization, and technology. I have strong interests in data science, supply chain optimization, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) analytics.

Outside of academics, I love exploring new places, trying out spicy foods (especially ramen üçú), and spending time with my energetic Yorkie puppy. I'm originally from northern New Jersey!
