## Projects

### [Analysis of Violent Crime Rates](https://github.com/ag843/Violent-Crime-Rates-Analysis/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20Community%20Violent%20Crime%20Rates.pdf)
- Built linear, quadratic, and logistic regression models using Python, achieving up to 90.7% variance explained with quadratic regression.
- Implemented train/test split and identified model improvement areas through confusion matrix analysis.

### Toyota Material Handling
- Developing a Python script to streamline domestic part ordering, optimizing inventory management for Toyota Material Handling.

### [Crop Classification App](https://ee-ashnagupta.projects.earthengine.app/view/cultivate-land-prediction)
- Developed a Google Earth Engine-based application using Landsat 8 imagery to classify cropland and predict cultivated areas across South Dakota, Minnesota, and North Dakota with a random forest classifier, achieving 73% accuracy.
