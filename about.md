{% include nav.html %}
I’ve explored the intersection of data, engineering, and business through experiences at Amazon, where I supported regional cost optimization as a Financial Data Analyst, and at Procter & Gamble, where I improved manufacturing efficiency as a Process Engineering Intern. I’ve also contributed to academic and campus initiatives, serving as a Teaching Assistant for Supply Chain Management and mentoring first-year students as a Peer Advisor. Beyond the classroom, I led the Cornell Hyperloop structures subteam and built data-driven tools, including a cropland classification app using satellite imagery and a predictive model for community violent crime rates. I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and create scalable, impactful solutions.
